7/7 by Jayson on test-branch-1 - Another CSS fix; chatbot preparation

Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the inline-flex items-center div would appear in the HTML even if unauthenticated, by moving the auth and endauth blocks to cover the whole div.
- Fixed an issue where the ESP32 text in the About page would not be rendered as text-gray-900, by changing the erroneous text-gray-90 to text-gray-900.
- Fixed an issue where the dropdowns.js file would not be found in the About or 403 pages, by setting the src in the app and errs layouts to include asset {{}}.
- Fixed an issue where no error messages would show when creating a blank note or editing a note/title field to be invalid.
- Fixed an issue where the navbar would be overlapped by other page elements. The navbar has now been brought to z-index 10 to guarantee its placement above all other page elements.

Additions and removals:
- Added this file.
- Added MQTT image.
- Added the pressure_sessions migration file.
- Added data validation for the "title" attribute of all notes.
- Added a placeholder chatbot section into the chatbot index.
- Added help text to note creation and editing pages.
- The notes div and account table div are no longer hideable.
- Titles can now be added to notes in the creation page.

Modifications:
- Note View and Edit buttons have been positioned to the bottom with the creation of a flex box within each note div. Titles also only occupy 1 line.
- Updated the migrations files to be more up to date with the current database. They now add the pressure_sessions table.
- Updated the 403 error page layout.
- Updated the DatabaseSeeder to only seed 1 note.
- Updated user data validation.
- Reworked the divs containing the note contents to be flex layouts.
- In the note index pages, truncated note titles to only occupy 1 line.
- In the note view pages, changed the section containing the note contents from p to textarea.

To be added.


4/7 by Jayson on test-branch-1 - CSS cleanup and optimisation

Additions and removals:
- Even less font-sans references.
- Removed Postmark.svg since we are not using it.

Modifications:
- Allowed the app to use UTC +8 rather than UTC +0 to align to our timezone.
- Standardised the margin, padding, and width of divs in most pages. The header sections now have a light green background.
- Separated the CSS classes in a few components into a few lines, with each line containing standard, hover, focus, or transition attributes, for easier readability.
- toggleDeleteMenu() becomes toggleOpenableMenu(). id delete-menu becomes openable-menu.
- Improved the look of dropdowns.
- Changed the font of the entire project, and lessened the font weight of headings.
- Moved dropdowns.js to a separate file.



3/7 by Jayson on test-branch-1 - Notes revamp; Account datatable addition; Differentiated login

Additions and removals:
- Added the account datatable page as well as differentiated login procedures.
- Added empty chatbot folders and files for a future commit.
- Removed most font-sans classes in most files that have this reference, except for valuable layout pages.

Modifications:
- Heavily revamped the Notes section to use more refined Tailwind CSS rather than the old CSS.



27/6 by Jayson on test-branch-1 - Added implementation for the Resend email delivery service.

Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the header divs in the home directory's pages would overlap the navigation menu by removing the "relative" class from the divs.

Additions and removals:
- Added Postmark and Resend images.
- Added an "uneditable information" section to the profile page with no database connections.
- Composer now requires Resend.
- Added sample email service implementation in the .env.example file to closely reflect how it is done in the actual .env file.



26/6 by Jayson on test-branch-1 - Introduced custom font to more pages including auth pages, and improved buttons

Additions and removals:
- Added ESP32 image.
- Added help text for the register, login, forgot password, and email verification pages.
- Added font-sans references (which were later removed).

Modifications:
- Made buttons and textareas have a green ring on focus instead of indigo.



22/6 by Jayson on test-branch-1 - Implemented more Tailwind CSS rather than unbranded CSS in the index and about pages, and included more non-secret stuff in the .env.example file

Additions and removals:
- Added Laravel and Tailwind CSS images.
- Added a JavaScript section in layouts/app.blade.php to toggle dropdowns.
- Added MySQL database connection implementaion in the .env.example file.

Modifications:
- Massively reworked the home directory's pages to use Tailwind CSS rather than my own CSS.



21/6 by Aqeel (rest of the code; he gave the code to me) and Jayson (second contributor) on test-branch-1 - Database integration commit on another branch

Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the images in the about page would not be lined up properly by adding my custom div class, "box", to the divs housing the images.

Additions and removals:
- A lot of valuable MQTT-related files that would not be touched on my end, but be touched on the other end (which is reflected in the 5/7 commit).

Modifications:
- Cleaned up the CSS in the home directory's pages.
